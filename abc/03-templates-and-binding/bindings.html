<!-- Following kept free of styling to aid in demonstration -->

<h4>My {{version}} Angular App</h4>

<p>Hello, {{person}}</p>

<p [innerText]="person"></p>

<h4>Expressions</h4>

<p>3 + 4 = {{ 3 + 4 }}</p>

<p>My mother is {{ personObject.mother + "!!" }}</p>

<p [innerText]="  'My mother is ' + personObject.mother + '!!'  "></p>

<!--
  Function calls in template bindings don't work with
  Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation and are best avoided.
-->
<p>Function result is {{ calculate() }}</p>

<p>In some earlier alphas, this would be an error:</p>
<p>Made up variable: {{ madeUpVariableName }}</p>

<h4>Sanitization</h4>

<p>Sanitized by <b>Angular</b>:</p>
<p [innerHtml]="stringWithHtml"></p>

<p>
  If you bind to innerText, the <b>browser</b> does it
  (note the different output):
</p>
<p [innerText]="stringWithHtml"></p>

<!--
  See the "sanitization" lesson for more information on how
  Angular processes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before they're
  sent to the browser.
